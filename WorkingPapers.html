        <h3>Two Sides of the Same Coin? How Cognitive and Noncognitive Skills Shape Academic Achievement</h3>

       <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This study examines how cognitive and noncognitive skills shape academic achievement in Maths and English among Irish secondary students, with a focus on gender differences. Cognitive skills are the dominant driver of performance, especially in Maths and for boys. However, noncognitive skills, particularly Focused Behavior (SDQ) and Conscientiousness (TIPI), play a larger compensatory role for girls in Maths, where cognitive and noncognitive skills can substitute for each other. English performance, in contrast, relies more consistently on cognitive skills, with limited room for noncognitive skills to compensate. These findings suggest that educational strategies should account for subject-specific skill interactions and gender differences, rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigates how cognitive and noncognitive skills jointly influence academic performance in Maths and English among Irish secondary school students, with a focus on gender differences. Using data from the <em>Growing Up in Ireland</em> longitudinal study, I apply linear and translog production functions to model these relationships. Findings show that cognitive skills remain the strongest predictors of academic performance, with slightly stronger effects for boys. However, noncognitive skills, particularly Focused Behavior (SDQ) and Conscientiousness (TIPI), significantly impact performanceâ€”especially for girls in Maths, where skill substitutability is observed (ES &gt; 1). In contrast, English performance exhibits stronger cognitive dominance and less substitutability between skill types. These results challenge the assumption of a uniform educational production process and highlight the need for gender- and subject-specific educational strategies that develop both cognitive and noncognitive skills effectively.</p>

        <h3>Educational Inequality and Gender Achievement Gaps: The Role of Skills and Socioeconomic Factors in Academic Performance</h3>
        <p>Preliminary results can be viewed <a href="CogNonCogGenderGap.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>TL;DR: Among Irish students, boys show higher performance in Maths, while girls excel in English. Socioeconomic status influences these gaps, with wealthier families narrowing the Maths gap and amplifying girls' English advantage. Behavioral traits like attention and conscientiousness often amplify these gaps, fueling workplace segregation and doubling down on both gender and economic inequalities.</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines gender achievement gaps in Maths and English among Irish students using data from the Growing Up in Ireland study. The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method is employed to analyze cognitive abilities, noncognitive traits, and socioeconomic factors. Boys outperform girls in Maths, though the gap narrows in higher-income households and with more educated primary caregivers. Girls excel in English, with this advantage amplifying in households with higher parental education. Cognitive factors narrow gender gaps, while behavioral traits like Hyperactivity/Inattention and Conscientiousness often widen them. Findings underscore the need to address educational inequalities and optimize skill development.</p>
