      <h3>(JMP) The Dual Labour Market and the Motherhood Employment Penalty in Japan</h3>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper studies how Japan’s motherhood penalty is structured across labor market positions using household panel data tracking 662 women around
  first birth. I document a sharp employment break at birth (-13.2 percentage points at t=0), preceded by a distinct pre-birth margin at t=-2 that is primarily marriage-related
  rather than childcare-related. The penalty is highly uneven across jobs: non-regular workers and women in weaker firm positions face substantially higher exit risk than regular
  workers in protected internal labor markets. In mechanism regressions, non-regular status and firm size remain the strongest predictors of pre-birth exit, while commute and
  husband overwork do not explain the pattern once job characteristics are accounted for. The contribution is to show that Japan’s child penalty goes beyond the lack of childcare supply; it is a labour-market segmentation problem. Employment partially recovers after
  birth, but recovery is disproportionately into lower-quality work, with persistent losses in hours and annual earnings among those employed. The evidence supports a two-stage
  interpretation: early exits around marriage and larger childcare-driven exits at birth—followed by a re-entry process shaped by the dual labour market.</p>

            <h3>Two Sides of the Same Coin? How Cognitive and Noncognitive Skills Shape Academic Achievement</h3>

       <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this study I investigate how cognitive and noncognitive skills jointly influence academic performance in Maths and English among Irish secondary school students, with a focus on gender differences. Using data from the <em>Growing Up in Ireland</em> longitudinal study, I apply linear and translog production functions to model these relationships. I find that cognitive skills remain the strongest predictors of academic performance, with slightly stronger effects for boys. However, noncognitive skills, particularly Focused Behaviour and Conscientiousness (TIPI), significantly impact performance (especially for girls in Maths, where skills are substitutes rather than complements (ES &gt; 1)). In contrast, English performance exhibits stronger cognitive dominance and less substitutability between skill types. These results challenge the assumption of a uniform educational production process and highlight the need for gender- and subject-specific educational strategies that develop both cognitive and noncognitive skills in an effective way.</p>
           
        <h3>The Timing of Educational Inequality: Early Mechanisms Behind Gender Gaps in Maths Achievement</h3>

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>In this paper I look at how gender gaps in Maths achievement develop among Irish students, using data from the Growing Up in Ireland study. I examine how factors measured at ages 9 and 13 predict Maths scores in the Leaving Certificate exam taken at age 17/18. Using Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions, I separate the gender gap into two parts: differences in measurable skills and traits (endowments) and differences in how those skills are rewarded (coefficients). I find that boys score 4.4 to 5.2 points higher than girls in Maths on average. When using age 9 predictors, most of the gap comes from differences in returns to skills. By age 13, actual differences in cognitive skills explain most of the gap. Early differences in treatment turn into real skill gaps by the teenage years. Family structure directly affects achievement. Students with absent fathers score lower on average, exactly 13.6 points for boys and 15.2 points for girls. For boys, this comes from both weaker skills and lower returns to family resources. For girls, lower Maths scores link more strongly to mother’s education and household income. These findings point to the need for early interventions to reduce gender disparities in Maths achievement and to address the compounding effects of family disadvantage on educational outcomes.</p>
