        <h3>Two Sides of the Same Coin? How Cognitive and Noncognitive Skills Shape Academic Achievement</h3>
        <p>Paper can be viewed <a href="Chapter_1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and a quick overview of main results <a href="Presentation_CogNonCog_Prod_Func.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
       <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this study I investigate how cognitive and noncognitive skills jointly influence academic performance in Maths and English among Irish secondary school students, with a focus on gender differences. Using data from the <em>Growing Up in Ireland</em> longitudinal study, I apply linear and translog production functions to model these relationships. I find that cognitive skills remain the strongest predictors of academic performance, with slightly stronger effects for boys. However, noncognitive skills, particularly Focused Behaviour and Conscientiousness (TIPI), significantly impact performance (especially for girls in Maths, where skills are substitutes rather than complements (ES &gt; 1)). In contrast, English performance exhibits stronger cognitive dominance and less substitutability between skill types. These results challenge the assumption of a uniform educational production process and highlight the need for gender- and subject-specific educational strategies that develop both cognitive and noncognitive skills in an effective way.</p>
           
        <h3>The Timing of Education Inequality: When and How Gender Gaps in Maths Skills Emerge and Evolve</h3>
        <p>Paper in its early stage can be viewed <a href="The_Timing_of_Educational_Inequality.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study examines the development of gender gaps in Maths achievement among Irish secondary school students using data from the Growing Up in Ireland study. I use Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions at two stages, age 9 and age 13, to separate differences in observed characteristics (endowments) from differences in returns to these characteristics (coefficients). Boys outperform girls by approximately 4.4 to 5.2 points in Leaving Certificate Maths scores. Decomposition results show that at age 9, differences in returns explain a larger share of the gap, while by age 13, differences in cognitive skills, particularly numerical ability, account for most of the observed gap. Family background also matters. Students with absent fathers experience substantial penalties in Maths achievement, with gaps of 13.6 points for boys and 15.2 points for girls. For boys, the penalty is driven by both skill differences and lower returns. For girls, maternal education and socioeconomic factors play a stronger role. These findings point to the need for early interventions to reduce gender disparities in Maths achievement and to address the compounding effects of family disadvantage on educational outcomes.</p>
