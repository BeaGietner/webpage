        <h3>Two Sides of the Same Coin? How Cognitive and Noncognitive Skills Shape Academic Achievement</h3>

        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This study examines how cognitive and noncognitive skills shape academic achievement in Maths and English among Irish secondary students, with a focus on gender differences. Cognitive skills are the dominant driver of performance, especially in Maths and for boys. However, noncognitive skills, particularly Focused Behavior (SDQ) and Conscientiousness (TIPI), play a larger compensatory role for girls in Maths, where cognitive and noncognitive skills can substitute for each other. English performance, in contrast, relies more consistently on cognitive skills, with limited room for noncognitive skills to compensate. These findings suggest that educational strategies should account for subject-specific skill interactions and gender differences, rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigates how cognitive and noncognitive skills jointly influence academic performance in Maths and English among Irish secondary school students, with a focus on gender differences. Using data from the <em>Growing Up in Ireland</em> longitudinal study, I apply linear and translog production functions to model these relationships. Findings show that cognitive skills remain the strongest predictors of academic performance, with slightly stronger effects for boys. However, noncognitive skills, particularly Focused Behavior (SDQ) and Conscientiousness (TIPI), significantly impact performanceâ€”especially for girls in Maths, where skill substitutability is observed (ES &gt; 1). In contrast, English performance exhibits stronger cognitive dominance and less substitutability between skill types. These results challenge the assumption of a uniform educational production process and highlight the need for gender- and subject-specific educational strategies that develop both cognitive and noncognitive skills effectively.</p>
           
        <h3>The Timing of Education Inequality: When and How Gender Gaps in Maths Skills Emerge and Evolve</h3>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study looks at when and how gender gaps in Maths skills emerge as kids develop. Using data that follows Irish children from ages 9 to 15, I found that Maths gender gaps evolve in interesting ways. Boys start with stronger numerical abilities at age 9, but girls' better reading skills and fewer behavioral problems (especially lower hyperactivity) help close this gap. By age 13, the mechanisms driving Maths achievement differences change significantly - cognitive skill gaps widen while girls start getting better returns on the skills they do have. Father absence hits boys harder than girls in terms of Maths scores, with boys showing a larger achievement gap (1.1 points versus 0.9 points for girls) when fathers are disengaged. What's really interesting is that this paternal effect works differently by gender: for boys, it's mainly about having worse characteristics (endowment effects), while for girls it's a more complex mix of different characteristics and different returns to those characteristics. These findings help us understand exactly when and how Maths achievement gaps form, which could inform more targeted educational interventions.</p>
