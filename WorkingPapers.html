      <h3>(JMP) The Dual Labour Market and the Motherhood Employment Penalty in Japan</h3>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Japan has among the most generous parental leave statutes in the OECD, yet one of the widest motherhood employment gaps. Using an event-study design applied to 662 first births in the JHPS and KHPS panels (2004-2022), I show that this puzzle is rooted in labour-market segmentation. Employment falls 13.2 percentage points at childbirth, with a clean near-lead null at t=-2. The penalty is strongly stratified by labour-market tier: among women employed before birth, non-regular contract status predicts non-employment at t=0 with an odds ratio of 7.50 (p<0.001), while small-firm effects are positive but imprecise. Post-birth “recovery” is largely an extensive-margin illusion - returning mothers shift from full-time to part-time work, and conditional hours, earnings, and implied hourly wages remain durably below pre-birth levels. Government training subsidies designed to support re-entry are effectively unused, with fewer than 2.5% of mothers reporting utilisation at any post-birth horizon. These patterns are consistent with weaker effective access to job-continuity protections in non-regular and small-firm segments, and suggest that statutory entitlements alone may be insufficient where labour-market dualism channels mothers into employment tiers with limited institutional support.</p>

       <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study examines how cognitive and noncognitive skills shape academic achievement in Maths and English among Irish secondary students, with a focus on gender differences. Using data from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study, I estimate both linear and translog production functions. Cognitive skills are the strongest predictors of performance, particularly in Maths and among boys. Noncognitive skills also contribute, especially for girls in Maths. Translog estimates show that cognitive and noncognitive skills typically operate as complements, with elasticity of substitution values below one. This pattern reflects diminishing marginal returns: the impact of improving one skill declines when the other is already well developed. A distinct pattern emerges in girls' Maths performance, where elasticity values above one reveal a substitutable relationship between skills. These results suggest the importance of educational strategies that support both cognitive and noncognitive development, tailored to subject matter and gender, in order to strengthen academic outcomes.</p>
           
        <h3>The Timing of Educational Inequality: Early Mechanisms Behind Gender Gaps in Maths Achievement</h3>

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>In this paper I look at how gender gaps in Maths achievement develop among Irish students, using data from the Growing Up in Ireland study. I examine how factors measured at ages 9 and 13 predict Maths scores in the Leaving Certificate exam taken at age 17/18. Using Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions, I separate the gender gap into two parts: differences in measurable skills and traits (endowments) and differences in how those skills are rewarded (coefficients). I find that boys score 4.4 to 5.2 points higher than girls in Maths on average. When using age 9 predictors, most of the gap comes from differences in returns to skills. By age 13, actual differences in cognitive skills explain most of the gap. Early differences in treatment turn into real skill gaps by the teenage years. Family structure directly affects achievement. Students with absent fathers score lower on average, exactly 13.6 points for boys and 15.2 points for girls. For boys, this comes from both weaker skills and lower returns to family resources. For girls, lower Maths scores link more strongly to mother’s education and household income. These findings point to the need for early interventions to reduce gender disparities in Maths achievement and to address the compounding effects of family disadvantage on educational outcomes.</p>
